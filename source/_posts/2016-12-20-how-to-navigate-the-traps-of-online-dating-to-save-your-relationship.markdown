This surely is a tech savvy age and the rise of smartphones are all the rage. It has transformed our society wherein online dating has been ticking all the wrong boxes. 
Men who are in relationships might be loyal to their women but nowadays, with this emerging trend of various online dating sites gaining popularity; men are drifting towards infidelity. These online dating sites provide a gamut of attractive facilities to woo men along with hundreds and thousands of eye-catching women waiting to get ticked. Men look for excitement in their lives and what better way than online dating sites? While being in a relationship, there are times when men look for other prospects for simply flirting and passing their time, these online dating sites are a boon for these men to talk with women they have never met or spoken with. 

## How to deal with it - 
Do not turn a blind eye to it, if you get acquainted with the fact that your man is getting indulged in online dating sites and is showing his interest in it. It can act like a dagger piercing through the heart but do not ignore.

## Educate yourself and research about his interest – 
If he sends across messages that are steamy and passion then he surely seeks or attention just like an egoistic man would want to do and if he is sending intimate and comforting messages then he is craving for affection emotionally.

You don’t need to feel that you are not of value for him because online dating is considered as a sign of infidelity and such men at times lack the ability of communicating their needs or it might even be the reason of his self-image. You need to reach out to him and talk it out instead of thinking about anything else. 

## Set your limits – 
When you get to know that your man is cheating on you, you need to set your limits there and then. Stop acting like an emotional freak and if you are serious for him; make it certain that he needs to make a choice. Don’t feel the pain of his entertainment and cut all ties of physical intimacy till the time he doesn’t get back to his senses.

Don’t burst like a volcano over him and try to be calm. Because he might take offence despite being wrong at his part. Also, don’t blame or argue, put out your heart on your sleeve and refrain from having any physical contact with him. He might comprehend the blunder he has made to his relationship. 
## Focus back on your life – 
Your happiness is equally important and if you cannot control his infidelity, be kind to yourself. Do not indulge in sleepless nights and swollen eyes. Pamper yourself and ignore his behavior. There are times when your self-esteem gets broken when your man does such things.

Bubble-up and make sure you date yourself and spend as much time with yourself that it makes you feel happy. Take your life back and maintain the respect and self-esteem in the ego, no matter what. Everything else will fall back into place and if he is meant to be, he will come back to you.
