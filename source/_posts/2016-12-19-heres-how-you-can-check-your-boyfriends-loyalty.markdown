It sends shivers down your spine when you acknowledge or even think about your beau cheating on you. Trust and faith are the base of any relationship. There are a few tests and ways through which you can check the loyalty of your boyfriend. There are times when you might be apprehensive of his behavior like phone number on waiting, replying late or reluctant to meet but it does not mean that he is cheating on you. Suspecting him for false reasons might be a disastrous feeling for your relationship so try to test him through the below mentioned ways.
## Steer clear from infidelity

You don’t have to hire a company to do the loyalty test for you. Start small and conduct loyalty tests all by yourself. You don’t have to involve scores of people to do this for you when some simple tricks can do the work for you.

## The Social Media Test
You need to develop a fake social media profile with a believable name along with photographs and friends so that it doesn’t look unreliable. The pictures that you post, make sure that those pictures are attractive and might woo your guy. Try to flirt and trifle with him. Try to judge his reply and check, if he is interested in that fake profile. Slowly and steadily ask for his number and check whether he reverts or not. If he is interested in that fake profile and shares the phone number then, he is certainly not trustworthy and you have proof to support the infidelity.

## Friends with Benefits
Take help from your friends and make them meet your guy. Try to observe his behavior and attributes while he communicates with your friends. Ask one of your friend to become overfriendly and informal with your guy and check his response. You don’t have to exaggerate the situation, ask your friend to call and flirt with him. Just in case if he is positive towards the entire philandering then he is surely not loyal.

## Sudden change in attitude
Try to observe his behavior, way of dressing, talking and meeting you. Is he ignoring you while giving you a reason of work overload or does he spend a lot of time surfing social media? These are some of the things which might be of concern for you. Does he not share his messages with you or he doesn’t like if you check his cell phone or Facebook account?

These are some of the ways through which you can confront your boyfriend and check whether he is loyal to you or not. You never know if he is a two-timing man or he has been cheating on you since a long time. You have to be frank and do not allow him to twist the things. If you are serious for him, try to confront it and work on your relationship. This would take time to heal because it can develop grudges between the two of you but time heals every wound. Give him a last chance but always remember that once bitten, twice shy; stay cautious and guarded.
