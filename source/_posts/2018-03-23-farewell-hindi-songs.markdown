Farewell Hindi Songs:
With spring comes the season of farewell, and marks the end of a golden era!!  It is the turn of life where everyone is equally excited and sad. The time where you realize "kaha aa gaye ham sath chalte chalte" and where you have no clue what "ajeeb daastan" life really is!!But you sure will carry lots of "yaadon ki baraart".
So with parting tears in eyes,will cherish the memories wali smiles on lips and promise to stay in touch Forver, bid goodbye to your buddies  in Bollywood Style!!

1. For the legacy you are leaving behind:
 Hum rahe ya na rahe
 
2. A wish to rewind everything:
  Give me some sunshine, give me some rain
  
3. Seize the day, seie the moment:
  kal ho na ho
  
4. Can't refuse, a friend in need is a friend indeed:
   Tere jaisa yaar kahaa
   
5. for the beautiful relation that friendship is:
   Yaaron dosti badi hi haseen hai
   
6. For the lost one:
   Behti hawa sa tha wo
 
7. And the farwell anthem, which includes all emotions:
   Kabhi Alvidaa na kahna
